        <h2>Belladonna</h2>
        <img class="contentimg" src="images/belladonna.webp" alt="">
        <p>Belladonna, (Atropa belladonna), also called deadly nightshade, is a tall bushy herb of the nightshade family
            (Solanaceae) </p>
        <p>The source of the crude drug of the same name. The highly poisonous plant is a native of
            wooded or waste areas in central and southern Eurasia. It grows to about 1.5 metres (4-5 feet) tall and has
            dull green leaves, violet or greenish flowers in the axils of the leaves or in the forks of branches, sweet
            shiny black berries about the size of cherries, and a large tapering root.</p>
        <p>The active agents in belladonna, atropine, hyoscine (scopolamine), and hyoscyamine, have anticholinergic
            properties.The symptoms of belladonna poisoning include dilated pupils, sensitivity to light,
            blurred vision, tachycardia, loss of balance, staggering, headache, rash, flushing, severely dry mouth and
            throat, slurred speech, urinary retention, constipation, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, and
            convulsions.</p>
        <p>In 2009, belladonna berries were mistaken for blueberries by an adult
            woman; the six berries she ate were documented to result in severe anticholinergic syndrome. The plant's
            deadly symptoms are caused by atropine's disruption of the parasympathetic nervous system's ability to
            regulate involuntary activities, such as sweating, breathing, and heart rate. The antidote for belladonna
            poisoning is an anticholinesterase (such as physostigmine) or a cholinomimetic (such as pilocarpine), the
            same as for atropine.</p>
        <p>The common name belladonna originates from its historic use by women, as bella donna is Italian for
            "beautiful woman". Drops prepared from the belladonna plant were used to dilate women's pupils, an effect
            considered to be attractive and seductive.</p>
