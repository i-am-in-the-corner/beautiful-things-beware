        <h2>Lily of the Valley</h2>
        <img class="contentimg" src="images/lilyofvalley.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Known by the scientific name Convallaria majalis, the lily of the valley is an herbaceous (the leaves and
            stems die at the end of the growing season and there's no persistent woody stem) perennial found in
            temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant forms large colonies by spreading underground stems
            and appears above ground with upright stems called pips. The lily blooms in the late spring and has white,
            bell-shaped, sweet-smelling flowers and small orange-red berries.</p>
        <p>The flower is delicate and beautiful, but can be poisonous when ingested causing abdominal pain, blurred
            vision, drowsiness, and reduced heart rate.</p>
        <p>Several plants contain cardiac glycosides, including Lily of the Valley (scientific name Convallaria
            majalis), Nerium oleander, Foxglove (Digitalis
            purpurea). Lily of the valley poisoning occurs from ingestion of the leaves, flowers, or roots. </p>
        <p>The cardiac glycosides are gastrointestinal irritants, may be responsible for a variety of cardiac
            arrhythmias (e.g., irregular
            pulse, bradycardia, rapid thready pulse, ventricular fibrillation), and can be fatal. With plant ingestions,
            the exact amount of toxin involved is never known.</p>
        <p>The plant has been used in folk medicine for centuries. It is said to be "good against the Gout", and that it
            "comforts the heart and strengthens the memory" and "restores speech to those that have the dumb
            palsey". Despite all this, there is no scientific evidence that lily of the valley has any effective
            medicinal uses for treating human diseases.</p>
